# The world university ranking regression
## Introduction
While choosing a university, it's common to rely on global or country-specific rankings for an initial assessment; however, this project tries to emphasize the importance of considering factors beyond rankings, such as the research environment, teaching quality, international student support, and industry connections. "The World University Rankings 2016-2024" dataset consists of all those elements. The key question is: What should students look for when they are deciding on a university? In simple words, what are the key metrics that students should consider when choosing a university? In the analysis, we aim to explore the dataset, employing a linear regression model to evaluate universities based on various key metrics.
